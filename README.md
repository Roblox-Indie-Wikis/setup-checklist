## Choosing A Home

* Buying a domain (or not?) 
    * A domain is your home on the internet. If you can, itâ€™s usually best for you to buy your own domain for identity. Most wikis use the .wiki or .org TLDs for their sites. Places like Spaceship and CloudFlare are good places to start looking. If not, most wiki farms and some online services offer free domains. 
* Hosting or Wiki Farm? 
    * Where will your wiki live? Some viable wiki farm options to consider are Miraheze and WikiOasis, or if you would like to self-host, DigitalOcean. 
* LAMP/LEMP Stack? 
    * If you are self-hosting, what stack will you use? Apache is generally best for most use cases, though ngix can better handle large amounts of data. 
* CloudFlare caching
    * If you are self-hosting, using CloudFlare to manage DNS, caching and email can be a cost effective and great way to speed up your site. 
* Works License 
    * Choose a license for your wiki Most wikis choose a Creative Commons license, which protects their interests but allows content to be used for others in some capacity.
